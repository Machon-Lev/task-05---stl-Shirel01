How it Works
The application reads city data from the txt.data file, where each city's name, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate are stored on separate lines.

The user  enter a city name. To exit the application, enter "0".

The user enter the search radius.

The user has to choose the distance norm:

0: Euclidean distance
1: Manhattan distance
2: Chebyshev distance
The application calculates the distance between the selected city and all other cities using the chosen distance norm.

The application displays the total number of cities and the number of cities north of the selected city's latitude.

The application lists nearby cities within the specified search radius, sorted by their distance from the selected city.
